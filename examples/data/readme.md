# Data 
Contents:
- epigenetics: Files in .csv format that contain the epigenetic information (ChIP-seq) of the H3K9ac and H3K4me3 marks. This information was obtained in the study by Kuang *et al.* (2014) under the access code [GSE52339](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52339)
- gems: Metabolic network of S. cerevisiae (iMM904) that contains acetylation, methylation and glycogen reactions. This metabolic network was downloaded from the [BiGG Models](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/) repository.
- knownFluxes: Known fluxes oxygen which was obtained by the percentage of dissolved oxygen reported by Kuang *et al.* (2014)
- mediums: Medium proposed by Kuang *et al.* (2014) where the sugars trehalose and glycogen were added.
- transcriptomes: Genetic expression (RNA-seq) across the 16 times of YMC. This information was obtained in the study by Kuang *et al.* (2014) under the access code [GSE52339](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52339)
