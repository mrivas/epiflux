# Examples
The use of `pheflux2.0.py` is exemplified in the following files:
- tutorial.ipynb: Tutorial of pheflux2.0.py using Jupyter notebook.
- example.sh: Example run of pheflux.py using Linux bash script. It calls the `pheflux-terminal.py` file.
Both examples use the information stored in the `data` folder and save the outputs in the ``results`` folder. The inputs and outputs are described below.
